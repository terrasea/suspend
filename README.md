#Suspend
## for non Systemd systems

Add a suspend menu option to system menu  

This is specific to Distros which don't use Systemd, which the latest Gnome 3.8 uses for suspend functionality. This would include Gentoo, and I think some others, but which ones they are I am not sure. Though it is possible to install and use Systemd on Gentoo, as the packages are there.  If the Distro you're using uses Systemd then this extension is unnecessary.

Requires UPower to be installed with introspection enabled.
